# NoGoodbye
A continuation of NoHello, but focused on embracing empathy and follow-up's in business relationships. 

NoGoodbye means, don’t Just drop the chat - help the person.

A companion to NoHello
(Or: how to not sound like a chatbot trained on Jira and Azure DevOps tickets)

⸻

## TL;DR

Chat isn’t just a protocol — it’s a human conversation.
If NoHello is about getting to the point, NoGoodbye is about remembering there’s a person on the other end.
Say thanks. Give closure. Follow up. Make people feel seen.

It’s not just efficient — it’s kind and promotes strong working relationships.

## Why It Matters

People are not APIs.
We’re not stateless endpoints that return JSON and await the next request.
If your time is so valuable, why aren't you sharing it? 

We carry context, emotion, and memory. When you close a conversation well, you build:
	•	💬 Trust
	•	🙌 Belonging
	•	🤝 Psychological safety
	•	🧠 Clarity that the loop is closed

And yeah, it still helps with productivity — because no one is left wondering “Is this done? Are they waiting on me? Did they hate my answer?”

## Don’t Do This:

**2025-07-07 09:03:41 you:** Hey, got a sec?
**2025-07-07 09:04:01 co-worker:** Did you read my NoHello status banner? 
**2025-07-07 09:05:00 you:** I was wondering about the data migration flags we are working on - I need your help...
**2025-07-07 09:08:23 co-worker:** Use --preserve-index and --skip-dry-run for prod.
… and then just disappear like you were never there. 👻

or:

2025-07-07 11:14:01 you: Can you check my PR?
2025-07-07 11:15:17 co-worker: Reviewed — looks good to me!
[you go offline]

⸻

Do This Instead:

2025-07-07 09:03:41 you: Hey, got a sec? I’m stuck on a deploy thing — mind if I ask a quick flag-related question?
2025-07-07 09:04:01 co-worker: Sure — what’s up?
2025-07-07 09:05:00 you: Is it --preserve-index or something else for prod?
2025-07-07 09:08:23 co-worker: Yep, that and --skip-dry-run.
2025-07-07 09:09:00 you: Perfect — that saved me. Thanks so much! Talk later 🙏

Empathy Is Not Inefficiency

Somewhere along the way, we started acting like warmth is wasteful. That politeness is overhead.
But human teams aren’t just optimized for throughput — they’re optimized for trust and clarity.

Adding a “thanks” or “talk soon” doesn’t slow you down.
It makes you a better teammate.

Inspired by NoHello — but going further

NoHello says: “Don’t just say hi — get to the point.”
NoGoodbye says: “Don’t just drop the point — remember the person.”
